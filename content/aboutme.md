# About Me
Hello! I'm Raymond Bukaty, but everyone calls me **Buck** (he/him).  
I'm a software engineer, most recently at Atlassian.  

Check out [my resume](buck_bukaty_resume.pdf), or feel free to shoot me an email at [hello@buckbukaty.com](mailto:hello@buckbukaty.com).

### My Next Adventure... 日本へ！
In 2022, I downloaded a language study app to learn some survival Japanese because I was interested in traveling there. Before I knew it, I was fascinated with the language, as well as Japan’s unique culture and institutions.

Now I’m rigorously self-studying written and spoken Japanese, and pursuing software engineering opportunities that would support my goal of moving to Japan!

In the meantime, I’ve found a part time job at a small Japanese-owned cafe in San Francisco, where I’m getting my first opportunities for real conversation practice with new coworkers and friends.
