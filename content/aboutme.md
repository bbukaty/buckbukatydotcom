# About Me
Hello! I'm Raymond Bukaty, but everyone calls me **Buck** (he/him).  
I'm a software engineer, most recently at Atlassian.  

Check out [my resume](buck_bukaty_resume.pdf), or feel free to shoot me an email at [hello@buckbukaty.com](mailto:hello@buckbukaty.com).

### What I've been up to...
If, in the beginning of 2021 when I had just left Atlassian, you told me I’d end up working at a coffee shop in San Francisco and casually speaking Japanese with my coworkers, I’d be at least a little perplexed.

I’m very fortunate to have been able to take this long career break to explore my hobbies, find new passions, and meet so many interesting people. (See below for more highlights!)

Now, having found a community and a sense of belonging, I’m ready to return to my software engineering career here in San Francisco, instead of Japan, my previous plan.

I’ve been challenged and I’ve learned a lot about myself during this time off, so with a new sense of what I bring to the table as a software engineer I’m excited to join a team where I can scale up my impact.
