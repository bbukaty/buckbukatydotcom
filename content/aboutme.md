# About Me
Hello! I'm Raymond Bukaty, but everyone calls me **Buck** (he/him).  
I'm a software engineer, most recently at Atlassian.  

Check out [my resume](buck_bukaty_resume.pdf), or feel free to shoot me an email at [hello@buckbukaty.com](mailto:hello@buckbukaty.com).

### What I've been up to...
After spending most of 2023 intensely studying written and spoken Japanese and networking towards on-site software roles in Tokyo, I made the difficult decision to change my mind and stay in San Francisco. Along that journey I had developed important friendships and relationships, and found an expansive and welcoming community for Magic: The Gathering, a hobby that has grown into a passion and a major part of my life.

Recently I've been exploring career options related to Magic and tabletop gaming more broadly, hoping to find the kind of direct and community-oriented work that I enjoyed during my time at Neighbor's Corner café.
