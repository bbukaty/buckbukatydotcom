# About Me
Hello! I'm Raymond Bukaty, but everyone calls me **Buck** (he/him).  
I'm a software engineer, most recently at Atlassian.  

Check out [my resume](buck_bukaty_resume.pdf), or feel free to shoot me an email at [hello@buckbukaty.com](mailto:hello@buckbukaty.com).

### What I've been up to...
After spending most of 2023 intensely studying written and spoken Japanese and networking to try and land an on-site software role in Tokyo, I made the difficult decision to change my mind and stay in San Francisco. Along that journey I developed important friendships and relationships, and found an expansive and welcoming community for Magic: The Gathering, a passion I expect to continue for many years.

After an exciting semester making data science contributions to an integrative biology paper at SFSU’s Stillman Lab, I’m excited about the possibility of bringing my software engineering background into the climate/sustainability space, but open to other kinds of software engineering work.
