# About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/profile-2022.png" alt="avatar">}}

Howdy. I'm Raymond Bukaty, but everyone calls me **Buck**.  
I'm a software engineer, most recently at Atlassian.  

I took some time off in the beginning of 2022 to do a number of things, like train for a half marathon, make [paintings with a robot](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VcmkXaNSP8ddhKYA6), and build [SpiritForge](https://spiritforge.app/) with a friend.

Now I'm starting to look for new opportunities, with a preference for small and medium companies with a direct positive impact.  

Check out [my resume](resume.pdf), and feel free to shoot me an email at [hello@buckbukaty.com](mailto:hello@buckbukaty.com).
