# Projects
*These are some of the projects I've worked on for classes, internships, or for fun.  
For professional skills, check out [my resume](resume.pdf).*
## SpiritForge
I took some time off from work in early of 2022. One of the bigger projects that I worked on during this time was [SpiritForge](https://spiritforge.app), a web tool I made with my friend Marina Landis to streamline the process of making custom content (cards and spirits) for the board game [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island).

## Generative Art
I had a lot of fun taking a class called *Drawing with Code* my junior year at Stanford, and since then I've sporadically been inspired to make more generative art.  

Recently I bought an Axidraw pen plotter, which I've been able to use to create some very unique paintings.

## VG-Relations
I made a neat visualization of Ranjay Krishna's "Visual Genome" dataset while I was interning with him at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/).

## CoNBot
Worked with my friend Amy Kanne on an AI game-playing agent for the game Crypt of the NecroDancer as our final project for [CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2018/): Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. I wrote a nice summary article about what we did, which links to the code and our report+poster.

A 3D puzzle game about using robots to get through a booby-trapped puzzle lair, made for CS248: Interactive Computer Graphics.

## SplatterVR
As a freshman, I participated in Stanford TreeHacks with 3 friends. We built a simple, fun VR experience for the HTC Vive in which you splatter paint around a massive white room.
