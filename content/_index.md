# My Projects
*These are some of the projects I've worked on for classes, internships, or for fun.  
For professional skills, check out [my resume](buck_bukaty_resume.pdf).*

## Nonograms
I was introduced to nonogram puzzles recently, and they reminded me of the kinds of problems you encounter on algorithm practice sites. 

It seemed like it would be fun to build a nonogram solver from scratch, so I intentionally didn't look up any existing approaches and dove into the problem. In the process, I also ended up building a web scraper for a large online nonogram puzzle database to test my algorithm against.

I ended up with a pretty competent solver that only got stuck on inferences that weren't obvious to me as a human (though I'm definitely a nonogram novice). It solved 87% of the ~4000 puzzles I scraped.

Here are some examples of puzzles it successfully solved and didn't solve. Orange squares represent the remaining unsolved portions of a puzzle.

## KanjiMorph
As I studied Japanese kanji characters, I wanted to make an art project involving kanji. I imagined them flowing between each other with "living" strokes.  

So, here's KanjiMorph! It's a custom animation algorithm I wrote that morphs between kanji characters by moving their individual strokes. To see it in action, look below for some of the kanji I was studying as I worked on the algorithm!

## SpiritForge
Another project I worked on towards the beginning of my career break in 2022 was [SpiritForge](https://spiritforge.app), a web tool I made with a friend to streamline the process of making custom content (cards and spirits) for the board game [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island).

## Generative Art
I had a lot of fun taking a class called *Drawing with Code* at Stanford, and since then I've been inspired to make more generative art.  

Recently I bought an Axidraw pen plotter, which I've been able to use to create some very unique paintings.

## VG-Relations
I made a neat visualization of Ranjay Krishna's "Visual Genome" dataset while I was interning with him at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/).

## CoNBot
Worked with a project partner on an AI game-playing agent for the game Crypt of the NecroDancer as my final project for [CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2018/): Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. I wrote a nice summary article about what we did, which links to the code and our report+poster.

## Laser Lair
A 3D puzzle game about using robots to get through a booby-trapped puzzle lair, made for CS248: Interactive Computer Graphics.

## Boundless Mind
I was a web dev intern at early stage company Boundless Mind, and I designed and constructed a web-based Business Intelligence dashboard for the sales team.

## SplatterVR
As a freshman, I participated in Stanford TreeHacks with 3 friends. We built a simple, fun VR experience for the HTC Vive in which you splatter paint around a massive white room.
