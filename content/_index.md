# My Projects
*These are some of the projects I've worked on for classes, internships, or for fun.  
For professional skills, check out [my resume](buck_bukaty_resume.pdf).*

## Stillman Lab Data Analysis Contributions
During the Spring semester at San Francisco State University I worked with [Dr. Jonathon Stillman](https://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/stillman/) and a group of talented graduate students on a review paper, Ecophysiological Responses to Heat Waves in the Marine Intertidal Zone.

Dr. Stillman wanted to know if it might be possible to use publicly available datasets to identify seasons and locations where low tide and peak sun exposure cooccurred, and how those factors contribute to intertidal heat waves. I began attending weekly class sessions and writing code to investigate this.


Using my background in data science at Stanford to work on a project with implications for conservation efforts was exciting, and I created a model of intertidal temperatures that compared very convincingly to recorded temperature data from a site on the California coast.

Dr. Stillman was excited to include this result in the paper, which is currently in review. I’m exploring my options for continuing this research and additional opportunities to apply my software engineering background to climate and sustainability issues!

Code notebook viewable in the [project repository](https://github.com/bbukaty/heat-wave-analysis/blob/main/09_scatter-plot-supplemental.ipynb).

## Nonograms
I was introduced to nonogram puzzles recently, and they reminded me of the kinds of problems you encounter on algorithm practice sites.

It seemed like it would be fun to build a nonogram solver from scratch, so I intentionally didn't look up any existing approaches and dove into the problem. In the process, I also ended up building a web scraper for a large online nonogram puzzle database to test my algorithm against.

I ended up with a pretty competent solver that only got stuck on inferences that weren't obvious to me as a human (though I'm definitely a nonogram novice). **It solved 87% of the ~4000 puzzles I scraped.**

Here's an animated example of a large, complex puzzle it was able to solve:

## KanjiMorph
As I studied Japanese kanji characters, I wanted to make an art project involving kanji. I imagined them flowing between each other with "living" strokes.  

So, here's KanjiMorph! It's a custom animation algorithm I wrote that morphs between kanji characters by moving their individual strokes. To see it in action, look below for some of the kanji I was studying as I worked on the algorithm!

## SpiritForge
Another project I worked on towards the beginning of my career break in 2022 was [SpiritForge](https://spiritforge.app), a web tool I made with a friend to streamline the process of making custom content (cards and spirits) for the board game [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island).

## Generative Art
I had a lot of fun taking a class called *Drawing with Code* at Stanford, and since then I've been inspired to make more generative art.  

Recently I bought an Axidraw pen plotter, which I've been able to use to create some very unique paintings.

*Ongoing*

## VG-Relations
I made a neat visualization of Ranjay Krishna's "Visual Genome" dataset while I was interning with him at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/).

## CoNBot
Worked with a project partner on an AI game-playing agent for the game Crypt of the NecroDancer as my final project for [CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2018/): Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. I wrote a nice summary article about what we did, which links to the code and our report+poster.

*Spring 2018*

## Laser Lair
A 3D puzzle game about using robots to get through a booby-trapped puzzle lair, made for CS248: Interactive Computer Graphics.

*Winter 2018*

## Boundless Mind
I was a web dev intern at early stage company Boundless Mind, and I designed and constructed a web-based Business Intelligence dashboard for the sales team.

## SplatterVR
As a freshman, I participated in Stanford TreeHacks with 3 friends. We built a simple, fun VR experience for the HTC Vive in which you splatter paint around a massive white room.
