# About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/profile-2022.png" alt="avatar">}}

Hello! I'm Raymond Bukaty, but everyone calls me **Buck** (he/him).  
I'm a software engineer, most recently at Atlassian.  

Check out [my resume](resume.pdf), or feel free to shoot me an email at [hello@buckbukaty.com](mailto:hello@buckbukaty.com).

### My Next Adventure... 日本へ！
In 2022, I downloaded a language study app to learn some survival Japanese because I was interested in traveling there someday. Before I knew it, I was fascinated with the language, as well as Japan’s unique culture and institutions.

Now I’m rigorously self-studying written and spoken Japanese, and pursuing software engineering opportunities that would allow me to move to Japan in late 2023!

In the meantime, I’ve found a part time job at a small Japanese-owned cafe in San Francisco, where I’m getting my first opportunities for real conversation practice with new coworkers and friends.

# Projects
*These are some of the projects I've worked on for classes, internships, or for fun.  
For professional skills, check out [my resume](resume.pdf).*

## KanjiMorph
As I studied Japanese kanji characters, I wanted to make an art project of some sort involving kanji. I imagined them flowing between each other with "living" strokes.  

So, here's KanjiMorph! It's a custom animation algorithm that morphs between kanji characters by moving their individual strokes. To see it in action, look below for some of the kanji I’m studying this week!

## SpiritForge
One of the bigger projects that I worked on during my career break in 2022 was [SpiritForge](https://spiritforge.app), a web tool I made with a friend to streamline the process of making custom content (cards and spirits) for the board game [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island).

## Generative Art
I had a lot of fun taking a class called *Drawing with Code* my junior year at Stanford, and since then I've sporadically been inspired to make more generative art.  

Recently I bought an Axidraw pen plotter, which I've been able to use to create some very unique paintings.

## VG-Relations
I made a neat visualization of Ranjay Krishna's "Visual Genome" dataset while I was interning with him at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/).

## CoNBot
Worked with a project partner on an AI game-playing agent for the game Crypt of the NecroDancer as my final project for [CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2018/): Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition. I wrote a nice summary article about what we did, which links to the code and our report+poster.

## Laser Lair
A 3D puzzle game about using robots to get through a booby-trapped puzzle lair, made for CS248: Interactive Computer Graphics.

## Boundless Mind
I was a web dev intern at early stage company Boundless Mind, and I designed and constructed a web-based Business Intelligence dashboard for the sales team.

## SplatterVR
As a freshman, I participated in Stanford TreeHacks with 3 friends. We built a simple, fun VR experience for the HTC Vive in which you splatter paint around a massive white room.
