# Researcher

> I've used [Olivier Roques](https://github.com/ojroques)'s [Researcher Hugo theme](https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher) for my website. Pursuant to its GNU GPL-3 license, my modified version of the Researcher theme (located in this directory) is also GNU GPL-3 licensed.  
As for modifications, I believe all I've really done is delete stuff I didn't seem to need for my website and change the font. I haven't added anything substantial.
